This is a clicker-style type game, very heavily inspired by Cookie Clicker by Orteil to a point it's essentially a clone.
I made the project as a way to improve my python skills and have a laugh among my friends.
This is the first actual "project" of mine, as in something that was made with a purpose that isn't a coding problem or very small and insignificant.
Making the game helped me with working with files (save file system), making a gui (tkinter), classes (creating buildings and upgrades), naming variables and functions to make them clear, working with git, turning code into an .exe, file structure and more.
I'm especially proud of making the clickable cookie only add cookies to the counter when it is clicked, not the whole rectangular button, having different building upgrades have unique colors as well as the save file system.
What I struggled with was the clickable cookie shape detection (or more accurately color detection), rounding problems and string variables, that were used for the gui.
Starting over, I would have write the code while making it look clean, use git from the start and maybe plan out in advance what the game is going to look like.

I actually had much higher goals for this project. Initially I wanted it to have multiple endings, have a lot of content and gameplay features and maybe publish it for example on Steam. The problem is that, as it is, it's a clone of Cookie Clicker, so i probably wouldn't be able to legally publish it. I also came up with some very good ideas for how the game would play out to a point that I don't want to waste it on a clicker game, at least a normal clicker game.
